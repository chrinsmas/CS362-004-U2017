Bugs in cards:

1. Adventurer: In the second while loop, the loop should run as long as z-1 >= 0, not greater than 0. As the result, the last card in the tempHand does not get discarded back into the discard deck.

2. Smithy: The card is trashed rather than set to the discarded pile when discardCard() is called.

3. Village: state->numActions should add 2, not 1.

4. Feast: In the hand resetting, the for loop stops a card short of the actual hand count.

5. Great Hall: Same as Smithy.
