1. Village Card: Action +1 bug
Error Message:
Error in village card, did not gain two actions in run

Bugs: line 740 in dominion.c
//+2 Actions
//state->numActions = state->numActions + 2;

Adding +2 actions should result in adding 1 action because player is using one action to play village card.
Original action: 1
Additional action: 2
Play Village card: -1
Remained action: 2 (original action + 1)

Code updated:
Line 742
//+1 Actions (=gaining +2 Actions)
//state->numActions = state->numActions + 1;

2. Adventurer Card: Discard Adventurer card bug

Error Message:
Error in adventurer card random test, did not gain two cards in run 959.
Number of cards in hand previous: 3, number of cards in hand after adventurer: 5

Bugs: line 652 and 682 in dominion.c
//int play_adventurer(struct gameState *state)
and missing discardCard function.

Without discardCard function, the play_adventurer holds onto adventurer card even after it being played.
This ended up causing an issue on total handCount.
In order to use discardCard function, I added one more argument for play_adventurer function.

Code updated:
Line 652
//int play_adventurer(struct gameState *state, int handPos)
Line 682
//discardCard(handPos, currentPlayer, state, 0);
Line 791
//return play_adventurer(state, handPost);
