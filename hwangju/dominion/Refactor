Assignment 2 - part 3 

Refactored cards:

1. Adventurer: The card loops while the amount of treasure cards drawn is under two. 
	In this while loop it checks to see if the deck is empty, if it is it shuffles. It then draws a card. 
	It checks the card to see if it is a treasure card. If it is then it increases drawn treasure 
	(what is used to check for the amount of treasure cards drawn), and then it repeats the loop. 
	If it is not a treasure card then the new card gets it added to a temporary hand with an index of z, 
	that z is incremented, and then the count of the current players hand is decremented. 
	At the end of the above while loop there is a second while loop that goes from z to 0 where z is decremented twice each run. 
	In this while loop the cards from the temp hand are added to the current players discard pile, 
	and the current players discard count is incremented.

2. Smithy: The card calls drawCard three times, passing in the currentPlayer and the gameState. 
	It then calls discard passing in the position of the hand.

3. Village: The card calls drawCard once, adds two number of actions. 
	It then calls discard passing in the position of the hand. 

4. Feast: The card loops to add one card that costs up to 5. Otherwise, set nothing. 
	After it adds a new card to a deck, it then update coins to buy to 5.  
5. Great Hall: The card calls drawCard once, it then add numActions once. 
	calls discardCard to remove the card from hand.
